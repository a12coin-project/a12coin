A12coin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
A12coin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. A12coin Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
